Wk 9 Homework Assignment: My Portfolio

This weeks homework assignment is a web application that displays my accomplishments thus far in the Harvard Extension School Full Stack Web Development Class.

I am displaying a few programs that I created from homework assignments and classwork.

I am also including my resume in my profile.

I have included 3 homework assignments in completed in class. 

The first assignment is a Train Scheduler application, which stores its data on a Google Firebase database.

The second application is a Trivia Game. The questions in the game are based on a cartoon theme.  Once the questions have been answered, a score board is displayed, which displays the results of your answers. 

The third application is a Crystal collection game. Each colored gem is assigned a random value between 1 and 12. Your objective is to click each gem and match the randomly generated target score. If you exceed the target score, you lose the game. There is a scoreboard located to the left which keeps track of your wins and losses.
